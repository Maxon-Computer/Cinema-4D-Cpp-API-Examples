# cinema4d_cpp_sdk_extended
The official programming examples for the MAXON Cinema 4D C++ SDK. This repository contains the examples found in the sdk.zip shipped with Cinema 4D, as well as additional examples. 

> :warning: Please note that this repository does not come with frameworks that are required to build the project solutions with Cinema's project tool and subsequently such solutions themselves.
